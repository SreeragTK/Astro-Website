					<h1>Necessary requirements for life to exist in any Planet</h1>
					<p>
The search for life beyond of Earth has been one of humanity's most intriguing and compelling topics since the ancient times. As a living organism on Earth, our investigation into life's influence on Earth's signature after its formation and how it has changed over time serves as the essential foundation for our hunt for life elsewhere in the universe. We are expecting that wherever life exists on a planet, it should have had an impact on that planet's atmosphere in a manner similar to how life on Earth has had an impact on that planet's atmosphere because we are assuming that our basic knowledge about the laws of physics, chemistry, etc. are universal in nature. Our understanding of life on Earth has led us to the generalization that three components are necessary for life to exist on any planet. These components are: 1) an energy source to power metabolic reactions; 2) a liquid solvent to facilitate these reactions. 3) a collection of nutrients to build biomass and to generate enzymes that catalyze metabolic processes.

					<h2>Water</h2>
					<p>The liquid solvent that is promoting the organic process, according to our observations on Earth, is "water" .But we can not generalise it to be the universal solvent facilitating the organic reactions since our knowledge about life is really limited as our only source for reference study is Earth.  However, there are several characteristics that strengthen the likelihood that water can be that solvent universally, namely: 1) Water is one of the abundant molecules used in cosmetics. 2) It is ideally suited for mediating macromolecular interactions due to its unique physiochemical characteristics. For instance, it plays a significant part in the known biological processes because of its capacity to establish hydrogen bonds, which makes it very effective at acting as a solvent for polar molecules. When we look attentively at the living things on Earth, it is quite evident. Here water  is essential for several processes, including protein folding, protein substrate binding, enzyme activity, and many more.

					<h2>Carbon Chemistry</h2>
					<p>The significance of Carbon chemistry in the biomass is another universal characteristic of life that we can learn from Earth. Carbon chemistry could be predicted from every planet with life due to a number of considerations, including: 1) its tremendous cosmic abundance; 2) Its capacity to synthesize an excessive amount of intricate molecules.  This is partly because carbon can easily make bonds with other atoms, allowing biomolecules like DNA and RNA, which are crucial for the growth and replication that characterise life, to take on a variety of shapes and functions.

					<h2>Evolution</h2>
					<p>The ability of life to evolve is another significant observation which we can obtain from the Earth. Evolution is a phenomenon that arises from an organism's ability to adapt to its changing environment. However, in order for evolution to occur in any creature, it has to have the existence of complex functional molecules in them which can survive in environmental conditions that are too hostile for them to develop and endure over the long term.</p>
