					<h1>A Brief Introduction To the Quest!</h1>
					<p>Whether or not life exists on planets other than Earth is one of the most fascinating and exciting questions that humanity has been striving to answer from the ancient times. Thus, one of the main objectives of exoplanet research has always been to use telescope observations to discover extraterrestrial life. The fundamental source of information for our quest for extraterrestrial life is our understanding of life on Earth and how it has affected the characteristics of Earth's atmosphere throughout the course of its billions of years of it's evolution. Because the rules of physics and chemistry are universal, we may look to the biosphere of Earth both now and throughout geologic time to find analogue signals that will help in the hunt for life elsewhere. We may thus anticipate the production of gases and other materials, such as pigments, which can have distinct spectral or photometric fingerprints, wherever the life exists. Here, whether or not life is discovered with the data must be stated with probability, and that necessitates the development of framework of biosignature evaluation. To estimate the possibility that a biosignature has been discovered, the frameworks must be built to link various types of scientific understanding of the environment in which our study is being conducted. Biosignatures must be understood in this context. Researchers have been attempting to construct various models for the last several decades to study this parameter space, where observations are numerous yet limited in detail. In this article, we attempt to provide some background information on biosignatures and how they relate to our search for extraterrestrial life. We also discuss how these biosignatures may be analysed and are being evaluated from our observation data by various models to target our search for life</p>
