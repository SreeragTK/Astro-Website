					<h1>Overview of Studies on Modeling Terrestrial Exoplanets</h1>
					<p>
Since Earth is the sole example(which is known) of a planet that is currently habitable, observations of it have been examined for the presence of biosignatures. These results have subsequently been used to assess spectral models that recreate Earth radiance spectra under various viewing geometries and cloud circumstances. These studies show that the vegetation red edge (VRE) surface biosignature, several biosignature gases (O2, ozone [O3]), and habitability indicators (H2O, CO2, N2, and ocean glint, etc.) may all be identified in Earth's disk-averaged spectrum. Different observation models or methodologies in these research will result in biosignatures with variable degrees of detectability.

					<h2>Spectral Models</h2>
					<p> Next majour models developed in this field comes under the catogory of spectral models. The scattering and absorption of light across a medium, such as the atmosphere, a body of water, or even a plant canopy, may be calculated using radiative transfer models. These models are crucial for determining the distant detectability of biosignature gases or surface characteristics and are used to create synthetic spectra of exoplanets. Depending on the simulated observing mode that is intended, different radiative transfer models will be used. Models for synthetic direct imaging reproduce how a planetary body might reflect and emit light. The incident star radiation that is dispersed (or specularly reflected) to the observer by the planet's atmosphere or surface is included in the reflected light. Here the thermal radiation from the planet is the light that is emitted. And models for transmission spectroscopy replicate the spectrum of light that has travelled through an exoplanet's atmosphere while it is transiting.

					<p>The atmosphere's gases of an exoplanet should interact with photons by dissociation, electronic, or vibrorotational transitions in order to be spectrally observable. Due to the fact that several gases absorb light at nearly the same frequency or wavelength, it is crucial to have the spectral range and/or resolution to distinguish between different gases in order to accurately determine whether or not they are present in an exoplanet's atmosphere. Let's now talk about the potential biosignatures associated with various planetary atmospheric conditions. Next majour models developed in this field comes under the catogory of spectral models.

					<h2>An example of a spectral model of Earth validated through observations</h2>
				<figure>
  					<center><img src="images/1.png" alt="Trulli" class="center" style="width:55%"></center>
  					<center><figcaption>Fig.1(Schwieterman et al., 2015b). It is showing a simulated quadrature phase UVOIR Earth radiance spectrum (half illumination). While the bottom two panels (2 μm < λ < 5 μm; 5 μm < λ < 22 μm) are shown in spectral radiance units (W · m−2·μm−1·sr−1), the top panel  (0.2 μm < λ < 2.0 μm)  is presented in terms of geometric albedo. The VPL 3D spectral Earth model created this spectrum . In addition to Rayleigh scattering and the location of the VRE, strong absorption features from O2, O3, H2O, CO2, N2O, and CH4 are also labelled. 3D stands for three-dimensional; CH4 stands for methane; N2O stands for nitrous oxide; UVOIR stands for ultraviolet-optical-infrared; VPL stands for Virtual Planetary Laboratory; and VRE stands for vegetation red edge.

Figure here is displaying a simulated UV-VIS-NIR-MIR (UV-VIS-NIR-MIR) spectrum of Earth created using the model called Virtual Planetary Laboratory (VPL) 3D spectral Earth model (Robinson et al., 2011). This model uses information from Earth-observing satellites to determine the atmospheric and surface conditions of the planet, including the amount of snow, ice, and clouds. These variables serve as the model input, which creates synthetic, time-dependent spectra of Earth that take into account specular reflection from the ocean as well as absorption and scattering by the atmosphere, surface, and clouds. The primary radiative transfer mechanism of the VPL spectral Earth model is the Spectral Mapping Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SMART) model, which is created by D. Crisp. The VPL Earth model integrates the projected area weighted intensity of the planet in the direction of the observer to produce a disk-integrated spectrum of the simulated globe. It can be expressed as,
$$ F_\lambda(\widehat{\boldsymbol{o}}, \hat{\boldsymbol{s}})=\frac{R_E^2}{d^2} \int_{2 \pi} I_\lambda(\widehat{\boldsymbol{n}}, \widehat{\boldsymbol{o}}, \hat{\boldsymbol{s}})(\widehat{\boldsymbol{n}} \cdot \widehat{\boldsymbol{o}}) d \omega.$$
where $$F_\lambda(\hat{o}, \hat{s})$$ is the disk-integrated flux density measured by the observer, $$R_E$$ is the radius of the Earth (6378 km), d is the distance from the planet to the observer, $$I_\lambda(\widehat{\boldsymbol{n}}, \widehat{\boldsymbol{o}}, \widehat{\boldsymbol{s}})$$ is the location-dependent specific intensity directed at the observer, $$\widehat{\boldsymbol{o}} ,\hat{\boldsymbol{s}}$$ are unit vectors in the direction of the observer and the Sun, respectively, $$d \omega$$ is an infinitesimal solid angle on the globe, and $$\widehat{\boldsymbol{n}}$$ is a normal unit vector for the location of the planet's surface corresponding to $$d \omega$$ Now here the disk-integrated spectrum is calculated by integrating the above equation over the whole observable hemisphere . These two equations are the driving equations of the dynamical core of the model. Now in any model we are considering it is not possible to implement prefect continuous simulation solution. So we need to follow any descritizaton scheme which does not invalidate our reasearch interset as well as fits well into our computational capacity. Here the paramatrization scheme which they followed is known as HEALpix parametrization. After this parametrization procedure, they divided the whole domain into different surface pixels and then used The Spectral Mapping Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SMART)(it is the core radiative transfer engine of the model) to calculate spectral database for these individual surface pixels. Now let us analyse the above mentioned result they obatained using this model.

Now let's examine the simulated figure shown above. This simulation is basically showing the spectral observation of Earth's radiance spectram. The lower two panels of the figure are described in terms of spectral radiance, whereas the top panel of the figure is shown in terms of geometric albedo. Here, we can observe that the various components of our atmosphere exhibit various absorption behaviours. Each of the three panels shown here corresponds to a distinct range of wavelengths. Let's now talk specifically about the first panel in order to understand how to analyse these types of data. There the dips corresponds to the absorption wavelength of the labeled gas/molecule. Here, we can observe that each of these molecules' dips has an own set of characteristics.Thermal widening causes wider dips, which suggests that the gas or molecule under examination is present over a wider temperature range (ie. broader the dip higher will the temperature range in which the molecule or gas is present). Furthermore, the depth of the dips indicates the abundance of the gas or chemical in our surroundings. So deeper the depth more abundant will be the molecule/gas. The chemicals or gases that were investigated here are all potential Earth's biosignatures. So, according to this work, we now have a general notion of how atmospheric spectra will be distributed in an atmosphere similar to Earth's.When we do this kind of research on an exoplanet, we can learn about its atmospheric characteristics and, using our basic understanding of how the presence of life might affect a planet's atomosphere, we can make predictions about the likelihood of finding life on the exoplanet we investigated.

					<h1>Study of timely evolution of Earth</h1>
					<p>
For billions of years, life and the environment have coevolved on Earth. The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis (OP), which resulted in the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere, was the most profound biologically mediated alteration observed in Earth's atmosphere which resulted in High levels of O2 at Earth's surface and that eventually permitted the birth and expansion of sophisticated animal life. The "Great Oxidation Event" (GOE), a brief period of time when evidence for this atmospheric oxygenation first appears in the rock record, occurred about 2.3 billion years ago. Between 750 and 460 million years ago, during the late Proterozoic and the early Phanerozoic, there were additional changes in atmospheric O2. The makeup of the biosphere as well as the oxidation state of the atmosphere vary during the course of each geological aeon. The spectral characteristics of a biogeochemical state of a rocky terrestrial planet in the Habitable zone of its star are therefore provided by each as a possible template or analogue.
