					<h1>Let us discuss more about Biosignatures</h1>
					<p>
The first question we ask ourselves when trying to determine if there is life on an exoplanet is what kind of information we are going to get from it or what kind of signals should be able to be obtained from it that may indicate whether or not there is life exists. The majority of the time, the information we gather for the goal of identifying life consists of spectroscopic signals (we should always careful about all the possible uncertainties in the data which can always be there due to various reasons like measurement error). The next stage is to determine the presence of gas or a surface feature that may be regarded as coming from a live entity after we get the data or spectroscopic signals. Here, only the presence of any biosignature gas or molecule may not be sufficient to infer the existence of life. Because both biological and non-biological processes can produce the gas or chemical we are thinking about here. Therefore, the only thing that can reveal the presence of life is the amount of that gas or molecule in an atmosphere that is more than what non-biological processes can account for.People often refer to a biosignature as "potential biosignature" when it is discovered on an exoplanet and has an abundance greater than this threshold. Therefore, it is not the presence of a biosignature but rather the existence of a potential biosignature that will indicate the existence of life on an exoplanet.

					<h2>Catogorizies of Biosignatures</h2>
					<p>There is currently no unified classification system for the huge range of possible planetary biosignatures. According to their own categorization criteria, many studies have used a variety of methods to classify them. One strategy that several researchers used, for instance, was to group them into three general categories: 1) gaseous biosignatures, 2) surface biosignatures, and 3) temporal biosignatures. In this context, surface biosignatures are biosignatures that can be seen in the spectral features imparted on radiation that is formed by radiation that is reflected or scattered by organisms, while gaseous biosignatures are biosignatures that are produced directly or indirectly by metabolic activities of living organisms. And temporal biosignatures are variations in quantifiable quantities that are related to a biosphere's activities and temporally recurrent patterns.

</p>
					<p>The atmosphere's gases of an exoplanet should interact with photons by dissociation, electronic, or vibrorotational transitions in order to be spectrally observable. Due to the fact that several gases absorb light at nearly the same frequency or wavelength, it is crucial to have the spectral range and/or resolution to distinguish between different gases in order to accurately determine whether or not they are present in an exoplanet's atmosphere. Let's now talk about the potential biosignatures associated with various planetary atmospheric conditions.

					<h2>Earth-like atmosphere</h2>
					<p>Here, an atmosphere that is "earth-like" is one where N2, CO2, and H2O are the dominant components (here, O2 may or may not be a significant component). It is also characterized by the presence of  High-molecular-weight gases (Mean molecular mass >> 2), such as a condensable greenhouse gas (H2O), a noncondensable greenhouse gas (CO2), and a noncondensable background gas(N2) in the atmosphere. It is crucial to note that the notion of "Earth-like" should not be restricted to atmospheres that are similar to Earth's current atmosphere, as it only represents a small portion of Earth history. The atmospheric composition of Earth has changed significantly throughout time and therefore the “Earth-like” notion is also dynamic. And other fact to note here is that, there are other "habitable" atmospheres for rocky, terrestrial planets besides this Earth-like ones. For example, other alternatives, such a H 2 -dominated atmosphere, are also conceivable for them.
</p>

<p>Other important characteristic gasses present in most of the Earth like atmosphere include Oxygen(From the surveys of neighboring habitable planets , molecular O2 and its photochemical byproduct O3 have been the most often mentioned astronomical biosignature gases.If we consider the atmosphere of the Earth The abundance of oxygen in the modern Earth's atmosphere is mainly due to the photosynthetic activities that take place here), Ozone(If we look at the Earth's atmosphere, the formation of 03, which is mostly found in the stratosphere, results from photochemical processes that divide 02. Therefore, finding 03 in an exoplanet's atmosphere can serve as a proxy for finding 02 produced by photosynthetic processes.), Methane(In light of Earth's situation Methane is produced as a waste product by an ancient form of anaerobic microbial metabolism which is called as methanogenesis.), Nitrous oxide(Earth's biosphere generates Nitrous oxide by the process of partial denitrification of nitrate to nitrogen gas.), Sulfur gasses(Several sulfur-containing gasses are produced in Earth's environment as direct or indirect products of metabolism.), Methyl chloride(the primary sources of methyl chloride on Earth are both natural and anthropogenic.), Organic Haze(According to the Earth's scenario, geochemical data indicates that during the late Archean geological aeon, Earth experienced an intermittent organic haze phase. Furthermore, it is widely believed that this haze phase would have had a significant influence on Earth's atmosphere, including its climate, photochemistry, and spectrum observables.) and many more other gasses.

					<h2>For other type of atmospheres</h2>
					<p>
It has been demonstrated that atmospheres with H2-dominant compositions might support life even with minimal CO2 and at installations below those expected for the boundaries of the conventional Habitable zones. The most typical kind of planet, according to demographic analyses of exoplanets from the Kepler mission, has a radius (and mass) somewhere between Earth and Neptune (it is a conclusion which is limited by the completeness of the  samples obtained from Kepler, which is biased toward short-period planets). These planets are referred to as "super-Earths," and because of their larger gravitational pull, it is more likely that in these atmospheres, over the course of geologic time, a low-molecular-weight component (i.e., H2, He) might also be able to exist in their atmospheres. Due to the efficiency with which they might be produced by abiotic equilibrium or kinetic processes, several reducing, H-bearing gases, such as CH4, C2H6, and H2S, pose a challenge as biosignatures in these environments.Similar to in high-molecular-weight atmospheres, the most convincing signatures will be those that have equilibrium or kinetic barriers that make it difficult for them to be produced abiotically, therefore a sizeable fraction of the signals that we are analysing will only come from biological sources. Here,  NH3, CH3Cl, DMS, and N2O are predicted as potential biosignatures in H2-dominated atmospheres(discluding NH3 these biosignatures where significant for Earth like atmosphere’s also). Research is being carried out to determine which gases or molecules fall under the category of their biosignatures according to various environmental conditions, and in the near future we may anticipate various atmospheric models matching to them to be established.
