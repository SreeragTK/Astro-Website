					<h1>Conclusions and Discussion</h1>
					<p>
One of the most intriguing and intriguing questions that humanity has been attempting to solve since the beginning of time is whether or not life exists on planets other than Earth. Our study of the impact of life on Earth's atmospheric signature after its birth and how it has evolved over time, as a living entity on Earth, serves as the fundamental foundation for our search for life elsewhere in the universe. Because we assume that our fundamental understanding of the laws of physics, chemistry, etc. are universal in nature, we expect that wherever life exists on a planet, it should have had an impact on that planet's atmosphere in a way similar to how life on Earth has had an impact on that planet's atmosphere. Our ultimate goal is to approach an exoplanet with life by looking for biosignatures that are abundant enough to support life.

We have a fundamental grasp of the biosignatures we may expect from an Earth-like atmosphere based on our observations here on Earth. And because of the technological advancements we have, we now know that there are other types of atmospheres that favour the emergence of life in addition to Earth like atnospheres. We now have a general notion of the biosignatures we may anticipate from those types of atmospheres. One of the most popular methodologies in this area of research is the analysis of spectral signals. Today, we have a wide range of computer models that can correctly decipher the information contained in every planet's spectrum emissions. We are continuously working to make those models more accurate. Once we have enough spectral data from many exoplanets and the effective methods to evaluate them, we may almost instantly have a clear picture of the atmosphere of those exoplanets, including whether biosignatures are present there and at what degree of abundance. Given the size of our universe and the abundance of exoplanets inside it, obtaining biosignature signals carrying potential biosignature signifying a planet with the presence of life is actually a challenging task to complete. In the near future we can expect that we will be able to get a spectral data with potential biosignature and thereby another planet with life in it.We can anticipate that we will be able to get spectral data with potential biosignature and, consequently, another planet with life in the near future.
